# Capstone Project: Finding the best store type in Toronto
###### What this project is about
If you were thinking about opening a new store in Toronto, what category would be the best fit? What are your competitions like or how popular is one category over others. Are there any correlations between these categories? 
###### What I Did 
- Used Python to complete this data science project with help of many statistical libraries
- Extracted data from Wikipedia and modified it through data wrangling
- Used statistical libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, WordCloud, Matplotlib, Folium, and sklearn to analyze data
- Used of Geospatial data to pinpoint the area of data I wanted to analyze, which in this case was Toronto.
- Used Foursquare API services to make asynchronous calls to obtain desired data
- Used machine learning to visualize data by using k-means cluster and Word Cloud
