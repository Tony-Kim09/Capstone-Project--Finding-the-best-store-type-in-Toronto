 The data I will be using will be the list of Toronto locations based on Postal code 
 as well as Foursquare API to find out the categories within each location. 
 With the combination of the Longitude and Latitude CSV file provided by the course for Toronto, 
 I will collectively use the data obtained to find a solution for the problem of finding the best
 possible category for different part of the city of Toronto.
